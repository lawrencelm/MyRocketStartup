# My Rocket Startup

===============

List of "rocket ship" startups. Looking for the next big thing.

> "Get on a rocket ship. When companies are growing quickly and they are having a lot of impact, careers take care of themselves. And when companies aren’t growing quickly or their missions don’t matter as much, that’s when stagnation and politics come in. If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat. Just get on." — Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt

## Forbes: "The Hottest Startups Of 2013"

|Company|Description|
|:-----:|:-------------:|
|Boxed|Offering free delivery on bulk goods, Boxed puts Costco on your smartphone. Despite the logistical challenges and slim profit margins of storing and shipping products, the New York-based company has grown from two states to 48 in the last quarter. Founded by former Zynga employee Chieh Huang in June, Boxed raised $1.1 million seed round in August from the likes of Bessemer Venture Partners, ENIAC Ventures and Social Starts. Average order sizes are a little over $100, though the repeat purchases on three months worth of toilet paper are less frequent than popping to your local store. They face competition from shipping behemoth Amazon, but Boxed is winning the iPhone wallets of young urban professionals looking to save money and time without becoming a member -- or opening a browser.|
|Blue Apron|One of several dinner kit deliveries, Brooklyn-based Blue Apron beat out competitors Plated and HelloFresh to become the largest U.S.-operating service of its kind this year. Former venture capitalist Matt Salzberg cofounded Blue Apron with e-commerce veteran Ilia Papas and expert chef Matthew Wadiak to help educate Americans by delivering unusual ingredients with easy-to-follow recipes straight to your door. At just $9.99 a meal with no subscription fee, Blue Apron is the cheapest in the market and currently delivers to 80% of the U.S. population. Founded in August 2012, it’s backed by $8 million from former Seamless and Facebook executives. Delivering 60,000 meals in July, Blue Apron expanded to serve up 100,000 in August and is now dishing out 300,000 meals a month, on course for 2013 revenue exceeding $10 million, FORBES estimates.|
|Coinbase|San Francisco-based Coinbase has become the most widely-used way to buy and transfer the online currency in the U.S. It’s also the most funded Bitcoin startup, with $31 million in the physical bank since raising a $25 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz in December. It now helps over 17,000 merchants including OkCupid and Reddit to accept payment in Bitcoin. Launched in 2012, by May this year Coinbase had just 115,000 users – now, that's over 660,000. Though the company will not share how much Bitcoin it is currently processing, in April Coinbase ran $15 million worth of transactions. With Bitcoin now four times the value, Coinbase's 1% cut per transfer is looking more and more appealing to investors.|
|Estimize|Providing crowdsourced earnings estimates for stocks, Estimize is an unsexy-sounding disruptor to financial services. Users enter earnings estimates which are added to overall estimates and can be tracked against other users, essentially making trading social. With 3,000 contributing analysts and 15,000 community members, Estimize predictions are more accurate than Wall Street's 69% of the time. Founded by former traders Leigh Drogen and Matthew Jording in 2011, last year it raised $1.2 million to grow operations. Bloomberg took notice: this year it entered a licensing agreement with Bloomberg LP to feature the company’s data on Bloomberg's 300,000 terminals.|
|FlightCar|As the sharing economy expands, FlightCar’s ingenius take on it – park your car at the airport and FlightCar will rent it out while you're gone – is already gaining traction in Boston, L.A. and San Francisco. Founded in 2012, FlightCar started operating in 2013, raising over $6 million to do so. All rentals are insured for up to $1 million, and users receive free airport packing and a car wash. If the vehicle is rented, the owner makes money. San Francisco airport has filed a lawsuit against the peer-to-peer car-sharing startup, claiming FlightCar needs to pay the same fees as conventional car-rental giants. Founders Rujul Zaparde and Kevin Petrovic are undettered: so far, they have had over 4,000 rentals to date, and over 3,700 cars dropped off. Currently operational in three cities, the Y Combinator graduate plans to expand services next year. Not on the cards, however, is college - the 19 year old middle-school-friends-turned-founders have put off higher education to work on the company. |
|Hired|Hired is upending human resources with its specialized curation of tech talent. With demand for engineers and designers on the up, Hired says it has become the largest professional matchmaker in Silicon Valley and is now finding employees for 720 companies including Twitter, Lyft and Pinterest. Every month it vets thousands of applicants before deciding the best 5% to work with. Once a candidate picks a job, the new employee receives a check from Hired for upwards of $3,000 - and a bottle of Dom Perignon. For every successful placement, Hired charges the company either a 15% fee of the employee's first year wage or 1% of the annual salary every month for 24 months. With salaries averaging at $128,000, the latter option nets Hired a healthy amount, but also means if the employee quits, Hired stops getting paid. Cofounder Matt Mickiewicz, who launched freelance marketplace 99Designs, says that won't be a problem - Hired only works with companies whose funding and focus on expansion makes them desirable workplaces. Launched by Douglas Feirsten, Allan Grant and Mickiewicz in 2012, Hired had just 265 companies on board at the start of 2013 when it raised $2.7 million. Now with 30 employees and offices in San Francisco and New York, Hired is profitable. |
|Homejoy|House cleaning startup Homejoy mops homes for $20 an hour. It may not sound glamorous, but if Homejoy's booming business is anything to go plenty of Americans don't want to get their hands dirty: Homejoy currently offers cut-cost cleaning in 31 cities. All cleanings are bonded and insured, with Homejoy offering a complimentary re-clean if customers aren’t happy. It pays its cleaners around $15 an hour, making profit margins slim, but wages fair. Since closing a $38 million funding round in December, led by Google Ventures, Redpoint Ventures and PayPal cofounder Max Levchin, Homejoy has raised just under $40 million – a tidy sum for a year-old company. Brother and sister team Adora and Aaron Cheung plan to make Homejoy the go-to service for home maintenance needs and intend to scale in a big way come the new year. |
|Sonoma Cider|Rather than bootstrapping, this hard cider company has been run with a tech startup's aggressive emphasis on growth. Founded by Robert Cordtz, David Cordtz and Fred Einstein, Sonoma Cider has been able to leverage $2 million in venture capital and crowdfunding via CircleUp to get on the market less than a year after founding. As the hard cider market doubles thanks to rising popularity among those who can't drink beer, the Headsburg, California-based company is on track to ship 10,000 cases this year. With 2013 revenue at $300,000 as the first bottles hit shelves just before Thanksgiving, the company has a projected 2014 revenue of $2.3 million. |
|WillCall|WillCall is taking concert tickets mobile. Founded in 2010, this year WillCall really got off the ground, raising $1.2 million from the likes of SV Angel and Napster founder/Spotify investor Sean Parker. Currently offering listings for San Francisco and New York, WillCall will continue to expand next year as cofounder Donnie Dinch hopes to turn it into a logistics solutions company for the $24 billion live music industry. Early adopters seem keen - in 2013 more than 1.7 million list spots at SXSW were reserved through WillCall. Though the app is attractive, its margins are slim: it must split meagre transaction fees with venues and promotors.|
